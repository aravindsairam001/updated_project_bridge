# Bridge Defect Detection System üåâ

A comprehensive deep learning solution for automated bridge infrastructure defect detection and classification using semantic segmentation. This project implements state-of-the-art computer vision models to identify and classify various types of structural defects in bridge images.

## üîç Overview

This system can detect and classify 11 different types of bridge defects including:
- **Rust** - Metal corrosion and oxidation
- **Alligator Crack** - Surface cracking patterns
- **Washouts/Concrete Corrosion** - Concrete deterioration
- **Cavity** - Hollow spaces and voids
- **Hollowareas** - Structural hollow regions
- **Spalling** - Surface concrete chipping
- **Rockpocket** - Aggregate exposure
- **Exposed Rebars** - Visible reinforcement bars
- **Crack** - General structural cracks
- **Weathering** - Environmental damage
- **Efflorescence** - Mineral deposits

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system is built using:
- **UNet++** with **EfficientNet-B5** encoder for optimal performance
- **Streamlit** web application for easy inference
- **Continual Learning** capabilities for model adaptation
- **PyTorch** and **Segmentation Models PyTorch** framework

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install torch torchvision
pip install segmentation-models-pytorch
pip install streamlit
pip install opencv-python
pip install albumentations
pip install pillow numpy matplotlib tqdm
```

### Running the Web Application

```bash
streamlit run bridge_app.py
```

This will launch a web interface where you can upload bridge images and get real-time defect detection results with color-coded segmentation masks.

### Training a New Model

```bash
python train_ninja.py
```

The training script supports multiple architectures and encoders. You can modify the configuration in the script:

```python
ARCHITECTURE = 'unetplusplus'  # Options: 'deeplabv3plus', 'unetplusplus', 'fpn', 'linknet', 'pspnet'
ENCODER_NAME = 'efficientnet-b5'  # Options: 'efficientnet-b5', 'resnext101_32x8d', etc.
```

### Continual Learning

For adapting the model to new datasets or domains:

```bash
python continual_learning.py
```

This implements advanced techniques like:
- **Knowledge Distillation** - Preserves previous knowledge
- **Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)** - Prevents catastrophic forgetting
- **Progressive learning** - Gradually adapts to new data

## üìä Dataset

This project uses the **DACL10K** dataset, a comprehensive collection of bridge defect images.
